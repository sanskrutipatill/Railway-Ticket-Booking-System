**Railway Ticket Booking System**

A console-based Railway Ticket Booking System developed in C++, designed to simulate real-world train reservation operations such as user registration, ticket booking, cancellation, and schedule management. This project focuses on structured programming, file handling, and logical data management.

Project Overview

The Railway Ticket Booking System provides a simple and efficient way to manage train ticket reservations through a command-line interface. It allows users to register, log in, book tickets, view booking history, and cancel reservations. The system also includes an optional admin module for managing train schedules and records.

This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as file handling, modular design, and menu-driven applications in C++.
